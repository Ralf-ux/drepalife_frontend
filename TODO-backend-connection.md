# Backend Connection Implementation

## Tasks
- [x] Update landing page to fetch backend data
- [x] Add state management for backend message
- [x] Handle loading and error states
- [x] Display backend message in UI
- [x] Fix endpoint URL and add test endpoint that works without MongoDB
- [ ] Test connection on emulator/real device

## Notes
- Backend URL: http://192.168.100.25:3000/api/test (for emulator)
- For real device: Use computer's IP address (e.g., http://192.168.1.50:3000/api/test)
- Backend now handles MongoDB connection errors gracefully and includes a test endpoint
- Backend is already running with CORS enabled

## Testing Instructions
1. Ensure backend is running: `cd BACKEND && node index.js` (will work even if MongoDB is not running)
2. Start React Native app: `cd bolt drepalife && npx react-native start`
3. For emulator: Should connect to http://192.168.100.25:3000/api/test
4. For real device: Update fetch URL to your computer's IP address
5. Check the "Backend Connection" card on the landing page for status - it should show "Backend connection successful! ðŸš€ (OK)"
